This is a simple website created for a carinderia, showcasing various dishes, their prices, ingredients, and other basic details. The project was developed in May 2023 as one of my earliest real coding projects while I was still learning the fundamentals of web development.

Project Overview
Technologies Used:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript (for add-to-cart functionality)

Features:
Displays a list of dishes with images, prices, and ingredients.
Includes a basic add-to-cart functionality using JavaScript.
Responsive design for better user experience on various devices.

Usage:
Browse through the dishes displayed on the website.
Use the "Add to Cart" functionality to select dishes.

Learning Experience:
This project holds a special place in my coding journey as one of my earliest endeavors. At the time, I hadnâ€™t fully grasped the concepts of web development, but I was eager to learn and apply what I knew. Although I recognize that there are mistakes in both the design and the code structure, this experience has been incredibly valuable.

Through this project, I gained practical insights into HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript functionality. I learned how to display a variety of dishes, their prices, and ingredients, and even implemented a simple "add to cart" feature. Each aspect of this project has taught me something new about the development process.

As I continue to grow my skills, I look forward to revisiting this project to add more features and improve the design. This experience has fueled my passion for coding and has motivated me to strive for better practices in my future work.
