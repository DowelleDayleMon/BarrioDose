        <h2>About Sisig</h2>
        <p>Sisig is a popular Filipino dish that originated in Pampanga, a province in the central region of the Philippines. It's typically made from parts of a pig's head, including the ears, cheeks, and snout, which are boiled, grilled, and chopped into small pieces. The meat is then mixed with onions, chilies, vinegar, and calamansi, a citrus fruit native to the Philippines, which adds a tangy and sour flavor to the dish. Sisig is usually served sizzling hot, straight from the grill, and often accompanied by rice and a cold beer. It's a flavorful and satisfying dish that has become a staple in Filipino cuisine and is enjoyed by many both in the Philippines and around the world.</p>
